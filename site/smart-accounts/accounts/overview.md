# Choosing a Smart Account

## What's a Smart Account?

A smart account is a smart contract controlled by an account owner or other authorized entities. You can use it to manage assets, carry out transactions (known as `userOperations` or `userOps`), and more. There are many different implementations of a Smart Account, including Alchemy's [Light Account](/packages/smart-accounts/accounts/light-account).

## Kick Off with Light Account

The Light Account offers a straightforward, secure, and cost-effective smart account implementation. It comes equipped with features like ownership transfer, [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) message signing, and batched transactions. For most applications, we recommend using the Light Account.

Here's a snippet that demonstrates how to work with the Light Account using Account Kit. This snippet sets up a Light Account and initiates a `UserOperation` from it:

## Modular Account Implementation

The Alchemy team is actively developing the Modular Account Implementation, which adheres to the [EIP-6900](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900) standard. It's set to include all the features of the Light Account and additional functionalities. Additionally, because EIP-6900 is EIP-4337 compliant, the Modular Account Implementation is well-suited to the EIP-4337 ecosystem. The `LightAccount` design is forward-compatible with `ModularAccount`. Until `ModularAccount` is available, it's a good practice to use `LightAccount`.

If the Light Account doesn't fit your specific needs, you can always use your own smart account implementation with Account Kit. For detailed guidance on this, refer to the guide on [Using Your Own Account Implementation](/smart-accounts/accounts/using-your-own).

## Benchmarks

Here are some benchmarks for the Light Account and other smart account implementations you might consider:
